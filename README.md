Note that all four of us wrote our own final reports on three questions. Individual works can be found in files named by individual names. After compeleting individual works, we split the job to make a group final report. Specifically, Yilun Dai is responsible for part one, Zhen Dai for Part two, Zhengyang Fang for part three, and Boxin Zhao for proofreading all codes and combining them together. Everyone fully participated in every question and made their own solutions, and we only splited the job when making group report.

The job split is a result of group discussion, and we worked together to make the final version of group report.
